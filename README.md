# Robust Sparse Smooth Principal Component Analysis (RSSPCA)

RSSPCA is a novel dimensionality reduction method combining robustness, sparsity and smoothness properties for face reconstruction and recognition tasks. The algorithm solves the following optimization problem:

$$\mathop{\max}_{w}||X^Tw||_1,  s.t. ||w||_2^2=1,  ||w||_1<=c_1,  w^TLw<=c_2$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are positive constants, and $L$ is a Laplacian matrix representing the two-dimensional spatial structure information of images.

The algorithm combines robustness (for outliers/noise resistance), sparsity (for feature selection), and smoothness (for spatial relationship preservation). It has been validated on six benchmark face databases (AR, FEI, FERET, GT, ORL, Yale) against methods including PCA, PCA-L1, RSPCA, and RSMPCA.

To run the demo, execute `main.m` in MATLAB. For large-scale applications, a parallel computing version is available at [RSSPCA_2](https://github.com/yuzhounh/RSSPCA_2). Additional benchmark face databases can be found [here](https://github.com/yuzhounh/Face-databases).
